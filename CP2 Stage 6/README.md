#Sports stars:

```js
cd node-mysql-login-registration-master
npm install
node app.js
```

Page Notes:
The sign-in page is called "index.ejs" (I decided to not change the name)
index.js and user.js are pages that act as navigators and process requests
app.js is the root file

Access Notes:
The application runs on: port 8080, http://localhost:8080
create a database called 'userdetail', then 'use userdetail;'
paste the code from 'coaches.sql' file and the code from 'users.sql' file.
grant access to yourself <- FINISH THIS

SQL Notes:
currently the database is not normalised

CopyRight Notes:
All images were taken from freepik (I do not remember all the authers) if this application was to be published I will make sure my memory will come back.
